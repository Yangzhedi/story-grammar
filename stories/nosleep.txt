  "I mean, I've kept " Adjectives.ScaryAdjective " things for my entire life. "
  "In fact, my nickname in high school was " AdjectiveChain " " Names.Protagonist ". "
  "Please don't start yelling. "
  Names.Antagonist " caused a lot of problems for me when I was growing up. "
  "If it wasn't for " Names.Antagonist ", I probably would have grown up much differently. "
  "Nobody ever asks nicely. "

  "That's why this story is so important to me."
  "That's probably why you'll be so scared by this dreadful tale."

  "The " Objects.ScaryObject " was decorated with a " Adjectives. " scene full of " Adjectives. " " Objects. "s. "
  "Like I said, it was a " Adjectives.ScaryAdjective " kind of night. "
  "Nobody got any sleep that night, that's for sure. "
  "When I first arrived, I felt a little " Adjectives. ". "

  "You do the math. "
  "This is my day. "
  "This is the first time I've heard something so " Adjectives.ScaryAdjective ". "
  "Great. Another " Objects.ScaryObject ", I say to myself. "
  "So, " Names.Antagonist " says to me, you've got an eye on that " Objects.ScaryObject "? "

  "I realized that " Names.Antagonist " put " Objects. " on top of my " Objects. ", and I start to book it out of there. "
  "Never said I was good at this kind of thing. "
  "Of all the things that would cause this, I wouldn't have ever suggested that my " Objects.ScaryObject " would be the thing to bring me down. "
  "I'd be honoured, of course, even if it's my last " Objects.ScaryObject ". "

  "That was the last we ever saw of the " Objects.ScaryObject "."
  "We never heard from " Names.Antagonist " again."
  "And " Names.Antagonist " died."
